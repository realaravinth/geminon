# Geminon --- A space hidden away from the internet

Through Geminon, I hope to share my professional journey in tech. This is a purely techinical blog with Today I Learned(TIL) style notes in the hopes of creating an archive of random topics from studies, personal practice, and books that I read.

I know that the internet has plenty of similar resoures on every imaginable topic with more authority. There are many like it but this one is _mine_. 

Regards,
